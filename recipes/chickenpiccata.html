    <h3>Chicken breasts are lightly browned and simmered in a bright lemon caper white wine sauce. Serve over pasta or with crusty bread.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspons lemon zest</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons capers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a meat mallet, gently pound each chicken breast to ½-inch thick. See notes for larger chicken breasts.</li>
        <li>Combine the all-purpose flour, lemon zest, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Dip each chicken breast in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li>In a 10-inch skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken in two batches for 4 to 5 minutes per side or until lightly browned and cooked through (165°F). Remove from the skillet and set aside to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and melt the butter in the same skillet. Whisk in the flour, scraping up any brown bits, and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the chicken broth, whisking until smooth after each addition.</li>
        <li>Add lemon juice, white wine, and capers. Simmer for 3 minutes, whisking occasionally. </li>
        <li>Add the chicken back into the skillet, and simmer in the sauce for 2 to 3 minutes or until heated through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
